        <p>First a pool drain needs to be done. While the water level is dropping, we pressure wash the entire pool to make sure there is no debris on the walls or floor. Once the pool is empty, we put on protective gloves, chemical goggles and rubber boots,
        and a breathing mask to protect us from acid fumes. <br><br>We then start mixing our water and muriatic acid. The dilution will vary depending on pool plaster condition or maybe you have a pebble tec. We mix this in a chemical friendly pump
        sprayer which gives us more control on the application. Always add the acid to the water, never pour water into acid. <br><br>First, we do a large section of the bowl and then we spray the pool walls with a garden hose and apply the acid/water
        mixture down the side of the pool. We wait about half a minute for the acid to do its work, and then we scrub the walls with an acid brush. After scrubbing, we thoroughly rinse the wall section once more and then move on to the next section.
        <br><br>We work our way around the pool, wetting the walls, washing and scrubbing and then rinsing to remove any acid on the walls. We then neutralize the acid-wash water in the bottom of the pool by adding at least two pounds of soda ash
        for each gallon of acid and give the pool a final rinse. After we have neutralized water with the right amount of baking soda, then and only then we drain the remainder of your pool. </p>
