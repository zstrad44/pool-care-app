        <p>Your swimming pool is a place for fun and relaxation. Each swimming pool requires a daily maintenance to preserve the water clean and safe, especially in the summer’s hottest days – you might want to check it twice a day. There are several jobs that your pool requires on a regular basis like: <br><br></p>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li>Water Testing &amp; Chemical Treatment</li>
                <li>Cleaning of pool surface, walls and bottom</li>
                <li>Sand filter back flushing / Cartridge filter cleaning</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <h4><span class="text-danger">Step 1: </span>Test the Water</h4>
        <p>Having a good swimming pool PH (power of hydrogen) level is essential in making sure that all of the equipment and chemicals used in your pool are doing their job correctly. That’s why it’s so important to test the levels at least once a week. Even in the off-season you’ll want to keep a close eye on it, because as an open water system, you’ll have nasty algae growth, fungus, bacteria.. If the pool is green, obviously very little to no chlorine is in the pool. Testing for chlorine is not very important since you’ll be shocking the pool anyway.<br><br> PH plays a very important factor though. If the PH is very high, the shock will turn the pool cloudy. (it will be cloudy anyway until it all filters out, but high PH will cause a VERY cloudy pool when using shock) I prefer to use a higher end test kit but the cheap test strips will give you at least an idea if your PH is high or low. You want the PH to be low; if the PH reads high use 1 gallon of muriatic acid. Don’t worry about adding too much acid. 1 gallon should be sufficient, re-test after shocking and 4 hours of circulation.

        <h4><span class="text-danger">Step 2: </span>Shocking the Pool</h4>
        <p>The process of shocking a swimming pool is done in order to remove various debris from it. There are many different organic materials that come from a person’s body when they enter a swimming pool. They include sweat, dead skin, and oils. Of course there is always the chance that someone has urinated in the swimming pool as well. While those aren’t pleasant thoughts, they are a reality of pool ownership, and this is the reason why shocking is so important. Once your PH is 7.2 or below you are going to start by shocking the pool with granular chlorine (calcium hypo-chloride).<br><br> We suggest purchasing a 25 pound container of this rather than the individual 1 pound bags they sell at pool stores or large chain stores. You’ll save a great deal of money and will need it in the future for small doses from time to time. Use 5 pounds of granular shock or 10 gallons (4 – 2.5 gallon jugs) of liquid chlorine. With the filter pump on, broadcast evenly over the water covering the entire pool surface until all 5 pounds of shock, or 10 gallons of liquid chlorine have been used. Be sure to use a good algaecide as well. Algaecide products can be found on this page. Algaecide can be added after a few hours of circulation.

        <h4><span class="text-danger">Step 3: </span>Filtration</h4>
        <p>What type of filter do you have? There is a lot of confusion about various filters, and many different opinions. Here are a few facts to consider. The first is that a pool can be properly maintained with any of the filter systems available: Sand, Cartridge, or Diatomaceous Earth (DE).<br><br></p>
        <p>Follow these steps for filter listed…<br><br> D.E. (diatomaceous earth) Filter: Before anything, backwash DE filter. Add fresh DE powder, shock pool as explained above and run the pump for 24 hours. Make sure there are no obstructions on pool drain such as leaves, trash, etc. After all, the pool is green and you can’t see the drain. Just run a brush over where you know approximately where the main drain is at the deep end of the pool.<br><br>Sand Filter: Same as DE filter except the backwash time should be a minimum of five minutes <br><br> Cartridge Filter: Make sure it’s in good condition and rinsed thoroughly.<br><br></p>
        <h4><span class="text-danger">Step 4: </span>The Payoff</h4>
        <p>After 24 hours of chemicals and circulation, you will see an amazing transformation. Your pool should not be “green” anymore. Although it will be cloudy and will need a lot of brushing and filtration for the next few days. There will probably still be a few isolated green areas that need some brushing. After 24 hours of constant circulation, backwash filter.<br><br></p>
        <h4><span class="text-danger">Step 5: </span>Maintain Your Pool</h4>
        <p>Proper water chemistry is required to keep a swimming pool safe and clean for swimmers, and maintaining a swimming pool’s chemicals can save pool owners time and money. <br><br></p>
